Hi! I am Software Engineer - Data/ML at Citibank, Dallas. I work on IVR and Agent-assist platforms for banking systems. 
I graduated from University of Washington, Seattle with Masters degree in ME - Data Science.  I am deeply passionate about Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing and love to keep myself abreast with the latest ML research. 

I did my summer internship at Sportsbox.ai, Inc. where I worked on 3D human pose generation for golf swings. Before this, I was a Data Analyst at Deloitte India LLP  where I worked with ML pipelines on MS Azure to generate sales recommendations and analysis using multiple KPI statistics for millions of outlets across different countries. I enjoy working on real-world problems which result in positive outcomes for the betterment of society.
